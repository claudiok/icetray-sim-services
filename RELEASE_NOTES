Revisions : 
More fixes to PropagatorServiceUtils::Propagate.  The copy was not
updated.  The original tree was updated and a pointer to the unadulterated
copy was returned.  In addition to the tree pointer needed to be passed
by reference.  It would have been nice if Alex-of-May-18th included
a simple test along with revision 88449 that tested this.  The current 
version ( V01-02-02 ) does include tests for all three flavors.  There
are 6 tests ( two x three for each function and flavor ).

Revisions : 88449
Fixed PropagatorServiceUtils::Propagate.  MMC can add propagatable
particles as daughters to the original, especially when using AtmFlux.
Since the tree was updated and iterated in-place the daughters would
be propagated, causing an infinite loop.  Now the original tree
is iterated over and a copy is updated.
